Laser Pong
==========
Two player pong via laser projector. 
Documentation isn't written, but I'm not quite done with this game anyway.

**TODO**

* Scoring
* Better surface
* Better bounce: trig wrt. force vector, gravity, etc.
* Better shapes, blanking, etc.
* GML/SVG displays:
	* Start Screen
	* Numeric Scores
	* Game Over / Victory Screen
* Ver2.0/Extra:
	* Cool ball/spin effects
	* Multiple balls

* Take the base "streamer", "surface", "entity", etc. and make python 
  "library" that I can use in other projects. Would be good for quick
  scripting and experiments when Light Engine won't be appropriate.
